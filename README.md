# API to learn about testing in java

It is a basic project to learn the use of mockito and junit 5 in java, doing tests on service classes, resources and exceptions classes.

This project is important because it gives me the knowledge to work with these very important backend technologies with java spring boot.

I followed this learning project with Valdir Cezar on the java testing playlist on youtube:
